Group Capstone Project: Re-Creating a Dice Game
Overview
Welcome to our Group Capstone Project, where we aimed to recreate a browser-based dice game with enhanced functionality and improved user experience. The goal of this project was to not only implement the core mechanics of the game but also to elevate its interactivity and visual appeal.

Project Goals
Enhanced Gameplay: Develop clear rules and mechanics for the game, ensuring an engaging experience for players.
User Interactions: Implement intuitive user interactions through buttons and other UI elements to facilitate gameplay.
Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Update the game state dynamically on the webpage to provide real-time feedback to players.
Efficient Game State Management: Efficiently manage and update the game state in JavaScript code, ensuring smooth gameplay.
Improving Existing Design: Identify and implement improvements to the existing dice game design, focusing on gameplay mechanics, UI/UX enhancements, and additional features.
Error Handling and Validation: Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as invalid input or game state inconsistencies, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.
Requirements
To meet the project goals, we've outlined specific requirements that our implementation must fulfill:

Game Rules & Mechanics: Clearly define the rules and mechanics of the game, including the number of dice to be rolled, turn rotation, win conditions, etc.
User Interactions: Support user interactions through buttons (e.g., Roll Dice, New Game, Hold), triggering corresponding game mechanics.
DOM Manipulation: Display the game state prominently on the webpage and update it dynamically to reflect the game's progress.
Game State Management: Efficiently manage and update the game state in JavaScript, including player scores, turn management, and victory conditions.
Improving Existing Design: Identify areas for improvement in the existing game design and implement enhancements to gameplay, UI/UX, or additional features.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to address invalid inputs or unexpected game states, ensuring smooth gameplay.
Validation: Thoroughly test the game to ensure correct behavior in all scenarios, with foolproof logic and bug-free implementation.
Conclusion
This project challenged our team to utilize fundamental JavaScript skills to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience. Through creativity and collaboration, we aimed to deliver a re-imagined dice game that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of players. Let's roll the dice and create something remarkable together!
